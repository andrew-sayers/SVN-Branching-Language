# Most clients assume that recursive branches are impossible, but it
# is not unheard of for a sub-directories of one branch to be split
# into its own new branch.  For example, this could happen if a
# seemingly minor bit of code turned out to be the solution to a
# problem of general interest.
#
# This is known as a "subproject branch", and clients that choose the
# sanity-preserving approach of disallowing recursive branches are
# encouraged to treat them simply as a branch of the original project.
# This keeps a sensible log, and allows a sufficiently advanced
# version control system to spot the directory shuffle.
#
# Since this is not a perfect solution, clients may want to get
# confirmation from the user when they see a subproject branch.
